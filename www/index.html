        <li>business landscape

        <li>personal preferences
        <li>&lt; other contexts &gt;

        <h3>I am saying</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>this worked for us
          <li>this is possible (there is at least one example where it worked)
          <li>you may have success with something similar
        </ul>

        <h3>I'm not saying</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You should do this
          <li>You have the same problem that we solved with this
          <li>This will work for you
          <li>If you do the same thing, you'll get the same results

      <!--p>
        Recently heard someone share about a cool practice? Don't expect any practice to “just work” for all in you organization. Since every context is different, instead consider:
        <ol>
          <li>Try it out
          <li>Inspect
          <li>Adapt
          <li>Rinse and repeat
        </ol>
      </p-->
