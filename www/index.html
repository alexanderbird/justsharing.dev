        Whereas some folks share their experiences as a recommendation,
        some of us find it more effective to share our experiences anecdotally.

      <h3>Example: Woody Zuill's Tech Talk Intro</h3>
      <p>
        In this 30 second introduction to his presentation on mob programming,
        Woody Zuill describes a principle that we're now calling <i>just sharing</i>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The first time I talked about [the practice I'm about to present],
        people seemed to be wanting to know what they should do. And I don't
        believe I can tell anybody what they should do. I can't tell you what
        you should do. So I really go along with this quote from Peter Block.
        I'm not here to tell you how or whether you should do this. I'm telling
        you why we did it, and how we did it. And then you can decide for
        yourself what you want to do. I think there's a lot of good in [the
        practice I'm about to present] and that's why I'm sharing it.
      </blockquote>
